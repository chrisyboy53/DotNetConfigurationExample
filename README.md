# Example of using Configuration

This is an example in DotNet Core to show a quick example of loading configurations.

## How to run this demo

It isn't mandatory but for demo purporses set an `EnvironmentName` in the environment variables to help load in optional config.
In this demo a Development config has been given.

Once you've setup the environment variable (**optional**) run this in the terminal.

```bash

dotnet restore;
dotnet run;

```
